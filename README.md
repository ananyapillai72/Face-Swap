The model consists of two sets of Conv2D layers followed by MaxPool2D layers and Dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The final layers include a Flatten layer to transform the data for fully connected layers, followed by two Dense layers with ReLU activation and a final Dense layer with softmax activation.
